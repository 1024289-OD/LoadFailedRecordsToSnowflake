# Data Rescuer

##### Gets the failed records of bulk data ingest jobs into snowflake error tables.
##### A corresposding error table for each object is created dynamically with three extra fields: j

- job_id
- sf__id
- sf__error (error message generated due to the failed processing of records)

##### Typer library in python is used to easily call the below functions implemented in the script

- **get_failed_ingest_job_result(job_id: str, version: str):** Loads the given Job's failed records data into a local CSV file
- **load_all_failed_jobs_to_snowflake(versionn: str, hours: int):** Loads failed records of all ingest jobs into error tables that are completed for the past given number of hours
- **get_all_ingest_job_ids(version: str, hours: int):** Fetches all the ingest jobs ids that are completed for the past given number of hours and returns a list of these job ids
- **load_to_snowflake(job_id: str, version: str, schema: str="TEMPDB"):** Loads the given job id's failed records into snowflake and takes the schema to store as a parameter
- **getJobInfo(job_idd: str, versionn: str):** Gives the job info of a given job id

**Authentication:** Snowflake authentication is done using external browser auth and salesforce authentication using the temporary token generated by the postman. Changes need to be done in the authentication part to make the tool more generalized.
